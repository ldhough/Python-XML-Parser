The c<em>ontent aware</em>&nbsp;technology synthesizes existing imagery to fill in gaps in the design. The stylized motifs overlaying each vignette are floral decorations and accessories appropriated from&nbsp;<em>The Vogue Archive</em>&nbsp;from the early 1900s around the time Bluemner phased out his architecture career for fine art. On collaborating with a deceased artist,</p><p>Creech responded to Stetson's collection and a selection of texts.

Creech uses <em>content aware</em>&nbsp;technology to create patterns of colors and shapes -- digital collages -- based off of selections from the Bluemner collection. The c<em>ontent aware</em>&nbsp;technology synthesizes existing imagery to fill in gaps in the design. The stylized motifs overlaying each vignette are floral decorations and accessories appropriated from&nbsp;<em>The Vogue Archive</em>&nbsp;from the early 1900s around the time Bluemner phased out his architecture career for fine art. On collaborating with a deceased artist,</p><p>Creech responded to Stetson's collection and a selection of texts. Bluemner’s color schemes and textures are preserved while contemporary abstraction tools and&nbsp;<em>The Vogue Archive</em>&nbsp;motifs are stand-ins for a collaborative counterpart.</p>",

            "description": "<p>Derived from childhood fantasies Eric Anthony Berdis’ work explores the metamorphosis of a becoming. Set among plush objects and phallic faux-fur sculptures, Berdis transforms into a nonviolent homophobia fighting superhero. Their performance seeks to simulate the jarring experience of being stereotyped while simultaneously examining the ways we navigate towards and create safe spaces. Loud sequined materials are reassembled as uniforms for a dystopic queer world. Each object holds a peculiar function, none of which are to clothe the body or to cover uncomfortable truths. With unrelenting confrontation with the audience they makes the viewer a mirror, and forces one to reckon with their own reactions to what has been crafted as both a worst nightmare and best fantasy.</p>",

            "description": "<p><strong><em>Garniture:</em> </strong>Visiting Digital Arts Professor Madison Creech presents a selection of&nbsp;Oscar Bluemner's work with a twist. Creech uses <em>content aware</em>&nbsp;technology to create patterns of colors and shapes -- digital collages -- based off of selections from the Bluemner collection. The c<em>ontent aware</em>&nbsp;technology synthesizes existing imagery to fill in gaps in the design. The stylized motifs overlaying each vignette are floral decorations and accessories appropriated from&nbsp;<em>The Vogue Archive</em>&nbsp;from the early 1900s around the time Bluemner phased out his architecture career for fine art. On collaborating with a deceased artist,</p><p>Creech responded to Stetson's collection and a selection of texts. Bluemner’s color schemes and textures are preserved while contemporary abstraction tools and&nbsp;<em>The Vogue Archive</em>&nbsp;motifs are stand-ins for a collaborative counterpart.</p>",

Creech uses <em>content aware</em>&nbsp;technology to create patterns of colors and shapes -- digital collages -- based off of selections from the Bluemner collection. The c<em>ontent aware</em>&nbsp;technology synthesizes existing imagery to fill in gaps in the design. The stylized motifs overlaying each vignette are floral decorations and accessories appropriated from&nbsp;<em>The Vogue Archive</em>&nbsp;from the early 1900s around the time Bluemner phased out his architecture career for fine art. On collaborating with a deceased artist,</p><p>Creech responded to Stetson's collection and a selection of texts. Bluemner’s color schemes and textures are preserved while contemporary abstraction tools and&nbsp;<em>The Vogue Archive</em>&nbsp;motifs are stand-ins for a collaborative counterpart.</p>",

Creech uses <em>content aware</em>&nbsp;technology to create patterns of colors and shapes -- digital collages -- based off of selections from the Bluemner collection. The c<em>ontent aware</em>&nbsp;technology synthesizes existing imagery to fill in gaps in the design. The stylized motifs overlaying each vignette are floral decorations and accessories appropriated from&nbsp;<em>The Vogue Archive</em>&nbsp;from the early 1900s around the time Bluemner phased out his architecture career for fine art. On collaborating with a deceased artist,</p><p>Creech responded to Stetson's collection and a selection of texts. Bluemner’s color schemes and textures are preserved while contemporary abstraction tools and&nbsp;<em>The Vogue Archive</em>&nbsp;motifs are stand-ins for a collaborative counterpart.</p>",

The c<em>ontent aware</em>&nbsp;technology synthesizes existing imagery to fill in gaps in the design. The stylized motifs overlaying each vignette are floral decorations and accessories appropriated from&nbsp;<em>The Vogue Archive</em>&nbsp;from the early 1900s around the time Bluemner phased out his architecture career for fine art. On collaborating with a deceased artist,</p><p>Creech responded to Stetson's collection and a selection of texts.

The c<em>ontent aware</em>&nbsp;technology synthesizes existing imagery to fill in gaps in the design. The stylized motifs overlaying each vignette are floral decorations and accessories appropriated from&nbsp;<em>The Vogue Archive</em>&nbsp;from the early 1900s around the time Bluemner phased out his architecture career for fine art. On collaborating with a deceased artist,</p><p>Creech responded to Stetson's collection and a selection of texts.

Through humor, video, print and the labor of an 8-hour shift, her work draws connections between consumption, the body, sexuality and spirituality.&nbsp;&nbsp;Residing in fly-over-country, she sleeps in her parents suburban basement and slices meat in a grocery store deli. The deli acts as extension of her studio as well as a tool to reduce the gap between artists and non-artists alike. How do we embrace our differences and share our sameness?&nbsp;Over the counter, she blurs the line between consumer and viewer, performer and employee, the workplace and gallery, art and life.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p>",
